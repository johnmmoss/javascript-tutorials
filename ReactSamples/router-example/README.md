**Note** the [version 6+ docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) didn't correspond to any of the tutorials, or the way I was asked to implement. See [What is the difference between BrowserRouter and createBrowserRouter...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75802982/what-is-the-difference-between-browserrouter-and-createbrowserrouter-in-react-ro)
